<h2>Cross-Domain Identity Management:</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is designed to make managing user identity in cloud based applications and services
	easier. The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development
	and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. It's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management
	operations by providing a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using standard
	protocols. In essence, make it fast, cheap, and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud.</p>


<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The SCIM Protocol is an application-level, REST protocol for provisioning and managing identity data on the web. The protocol supports creation,
	modification, retrieval, and discovery of core identity Resources; i.e., Users and Groups, as well as custom Resource extensions.</p>

<h3>Conventions</h3>
<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
	be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. These keywords are capitalized when used to unambiguously specify requirements of the protocol or application
	features and behavior that affect the interoperability and security of implementations. When these words are not capitalized, they are meant in their
	natural-language sense.</p>

<p>For purposes of readability examples are not URL encoded. Implementers MUST percent encode URLs as described in RFC3896 2.1.</p>


<h4>Attribute Notation</h4>
<p>All operations share a common scheme for referencing simple and complex attributes. In general, attributes are identified by prefixing the attribute name
	with its schema URN separated by a ':' character; e.g., the core User Resource attribute 'userName' is identified as 'urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:userName'.
	Consumers MAY omit core schema attribute URN prefixes though MUST fully qualify extended attributes with the associated Resource URN; e.g., the attribute 'age'
	defined in 'urn:hr:schemas:user' is fully encoded as 'urn:hr:schemas:user:age'. A Complex attributes' Sub-Attributes are referenced via nested, dot ('.')
	notation; i.e., {urn}:{Attribute name}.{Sub-Attribute name}. For example, the fully qualified path for a User's givenName is
	urn:scim:schemas:core:1.0:name.givenName All facets (URN, attribute and Sub-Attribute name) of the fully encoded Attribute name are case insensitive.</p>

<h3>Authentication and Authorization</h3>

<p>The SCIM protocol does not define a scheme for authentication and authorization therefore implementers are free to choose mechanisms appropriate to their
	use cases. The choice of authentication mechanism will impact interoperability. It is RECOMMENDED that clients be implemented in such a way that new
	authentication schemes can be deployed. Implementers SHOULD support existing authentication/authorization schemes. In particular, OAuth2 Bearer Token is
	RECOMMENDED. Appropriate security considerations of the selected authentication and authorization schemes SHOULD be taken. Because this protocol uses HTTP
	response status codes as the primary means of reporting the result of a request, servers are advised to respond to unauthorized or unauthenticated requests
	using the 401 response code in accordance with section 10.4.2 of RFC2616.</p>
<p>All examples assume OAuth2 bearer token; e.g.,</p>

<code class="prettyprint"> 
GET /Users/2819c223-7f76-453a-919d-413861904646 HTTP/1.1 
Host: example.com 
Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8
</code>

<p>The context of the request (i.e. the user for whom data is being requested) MUST be inferred by Service Providers.</p>

<h3>API Versioning</h3>

<b>TBD</b>

<h3>Versioning Resources</h3>

<p>The API supports resource versioning via standard,HTTP ETags. Service providers MAY support weak ETags as the preferred mechanism for performing
	conditional retrievals and ensuring Consumers do not inadvertently overwrite each others changes, respectively. When supported SCIM ETags MUST be specified as
	an HTTP header and SHOULD be specified within the 'version' attribute contained in the Resource's 'meta' attribute.</p>
