
<h2>Error Handling</h2>

<p>The Protocol uses the response status codes defined in HTTP to indicate operation success or failure. In addition to returning a HTTP response code
	implementers MUST return the errors in the body of the response in the client requested format containing the error response and, per the HTTP specification,
	human-readable explanations.</p>

<h3>Error Codes</h3>

<p>Implementers SHOULD handle the identified errors as described below.</p>

		<td>307 TEMPORARY REDIRECT</td>
		<td>GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE</td>
		<td>The client is directed to repeat the same HTTP request at the location identified. The client SHOULD NOT use the location provided in the response as
			a permanent reference to the resource and SHOULD continue to use the original request URI
