<h3>Actors</h3>

<p>Actors are the operating parties that take part in both sides of a SCIM protocol exchange, and help identify the source of a given Trigger. So far, we
	have identified the following SCIM Actors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cloud Service Provider (CSP): A CSP is the entity operating a given cloud service. In a SaaS scenario this is simply the application provider. In an
		IaaS or PaaS scenario, the CSP may be the underlying IaaS/PaaS infrastructure provider or the owner of the application running on that platform. In all cases,
		the CSP is the thing that holds the identity information being operated upon. Put another way, the CSP really is the service that the end-end user interacts
		with.</li>
	<li>Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS): An ECS represents a middle-tier of aggregation for related identity records. In one of our sample enterprise SaaS
		scenarios, the ECS is "FooBar.Inc" that subscribes to a cloud based CRM service service "SaaS-CRM.Inc" (the CSP) for all of its sales staff. The actual Cloud
		Service Users (CSUs) are the FooBar.Inc. sales staff. The ECS actor is identified to help capture use cases in which a single entitle is given administrative
		responsibility for other identity accounts. SCIM may not address the configuration and setup of an ECS within the CSP, but it does address use cases in which
		SCIM identity resources are grouped together and administers as part of some broader agreement or operational exchange.</li>

	<li>Cloud Service User (CSU): A CSU represents the real cloud service end-end user - the "person logging into and using the cloud service". As described
		above, and ECS will typically own or manage multiple CSU identities where as the CSU represents the FooBar.Inc. employee using the cloud service to manage
		their CRM process.</li>


</ul>
